title: Optimisation of the thermal design of the shell and tube heat exchanger
summary: Course project for design of heat exchangers and design optimization courses. Wrote a MATLAB code for the thermal design based on variable thermal parameters, material properties, physical structure and pressure drop in accordance with TEMA guidelines. Later included particle swarm optimisation to optimise the output design.
