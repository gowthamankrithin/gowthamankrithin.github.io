I am intrigued by how in nature turbulence is the rule while laminar flow is an exception. With the pressing need for sustainable development, I see the road to the engineering marvels of the future is by taming the fascinating chaos turbulence is.\nPlease find my comprehensive CV here.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"b6490a204c3379a2eebd3092031db504","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am Krithin, a visiting student at the International Centre for Theoretical Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
